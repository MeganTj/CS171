This is Version B of the assignment. To compile the program, run

make

and to execute,

./modeler [xres] [yres]


I have 4 raytraced examples. Three of them are the robot arm, where I experimented with changing
k, the attenuation component, between 0.2 and 0.01. I also included a raytraced robot arm where I 
changed the rotation of the camera angle from axis = (0, 0, 1) and angle = 0 to axis = (1, 0, 1) 
and angle = 1.
