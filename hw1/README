To compile the program, type 

make clean

and then

make

on the command line. 

Executing the program:

./wireframe [scene_file] [xres] [yres] | convert - [output_image]


I've attempted the extra credit portion but I'm unsure if it's correct, so I've included it as a separate file. To execute it: 

./wireframe_ec [scene_file] [xres] [yres] | convert - [output_image]
